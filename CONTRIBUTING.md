## Development

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"   # install with dev tools
pre-commit install        # enable the pre-commit hooks (runs ruff on commit)
```

The same checks run in CI:

```bash
ruff check .              # lint (also runs via pre-commit)
mypy                      # strict type-check
pytest                    # test suite
```

`pre-commit` runs only the fast lint/hygiene hooks; `mypy` and `pytest` stay in
CI. The vendored schemas under `omh_shim/schemas/` are byte-for-byte upstream
copies managed by `tools/refresh_schemas.py` — don't hand-edit or reformat them.

## Versioning & releases

[SemVer](https://semver.org/), applied to the whole public surface — which
includes the vendored schemas (consumers call `load_schema()` / `known_ids()`),
not just converters:

- **MINOR** — backwards-compatible additions: a newly served schema, a new
  converter, or new public API.
- **PATCH** — fixes with no new surface (e.g. re-vendoring a schema).
- **MAJOR** — breaking changes (removing/renaming a schema id or public symbol,
  changing `convert()`'s contract).

The version in `pyproject.toml` + `omh_shim/__init__.py` tracks the release being
developed: the PR that opens a new release bumps it to the target `X.Y.Z` (keep
`[tool.tbump.version] current` in sync). To publish, a maintainer moves the
`## [Unreleased]` entries in `CHANGELOG.md` to a `## [X.Y.Z] — <date>` heading and
pushes the `vX.Y.Z` tag — the release workflow builds and publishes to PyPI on
the tag.
