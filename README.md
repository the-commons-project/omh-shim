# omh-shim

Convert wearable health data from vendor schemas to [Open mHealth](https://www.openmhealth.org/) schemas.

## Status

v1.0 — initial public release. Public API is stable; converter coverage will continue to expand.

## Install

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/jupyterhealth/omh-shim.git@v1.0.1
```

## Usage

Timestamp-based data types (one reading at a known instant):

```python
from omh_shim import convert

omh_record = convert(
    source="ow_normalized",
    data_type="heart_rate",
    sample={
        "timestamp": "2026-04-09T08:30:00+00:00",
        "type": "heart_rate",
        "value": 72,
        "unit": "bpm",
        "source": {"source_name": "Oura Ring", "device_model": "Oura Gen 3"},
    },
)
```

Daily data types (``physical_activity``, ``sleep_duration``,
``oxygen_saturation``)
aggregate over a calendar day, so they REQUIRE an explicit timezone so the day
boundaries reflect the user's local day rather than silently assuming UTC:

```python
from datetime import UTC
from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo

# UTC-anchored upstream data
convert(
    source="oura_raw",
    data_type="physical_activity",
    sample={"day": "2026-04-09", "steps": 8432},
    tz=UTC,
)

# User's local timezone
convert(
    source="oura_raw",
    data_type="physical_activity",
    sample={"day": "2026-04-09", "steps": 8432},
    tz=ZoneInfo("America/Los_Angeles"),
)
```

Every conversion returns the full IEEE 1752.1 data-point envelope —
`{"header": ..., "body": ...}` — with UUID, schema_id components, creation
timestamp, modality, and `external_datasheets` auto-populated from the sample's
source metadata (a nested `source` dict, or the device implied by `source` for
raw feeds like `oura_raw`):

```python
convert(
    source="oura_raw",
    data_type="heart_rate",
    sample={"bpm": 72, "source": "rest", "timestamp": "2026-04-09T03:15:00+00:00"},
)
# Returns:
# {
#   "header": {
#     "uuid": "...",
#     "schema_id": {"namespace": "omh", "name": "heart-rate", "version": "2.0"},
#     "source_creation_date_time": "...",
#     "modality": "sensed",
#     "external_datasheets": [{"datasheet_type": "manufacturer", "datasheet_reference": "Oura Ring"}]
#   },
#   "body": {
#     "heart_rate": {"value": 72.0, "unit": "beats/min"},
#     "effective_time_frame": {"date_time": "2026-04-09T03:15:00Z"}
#   }
# }
```

`convert` raises `ConversionError` for unknown `(source, data_type)` pairs,
invalid sample shapes, naive (timezone-less) datetimes, or a missing ``tz``
for daily data types. It raises `ValidationError` if the converter output
fails schema validation.

## Supported sources and data types

| `source` | `data_type` values |
|---|---|
| `oura_raw` | `heart_rate`, `oxygen_saturation`, `sleep_duration`, `sleep_episode`, `physical_activity` |
| `ow_normalized` | `heart_rate`, `oxygen_saturation`, `sleep_duration`, `sleep_episode`, `physical_activity`, `blood_glucose` |

Body schemas resolve IEEE 1752 first, Open mHealth second, and omh-shim never
emits a schema its publisher has deprecated — where a deprecated Open mHealth
schema declares a successor, that successor is what resolves (`sleep_duration`
emits `ieee:total-sleep-time:1.0`). omh-shim emits only schemas published by one
of those two standards; where neither defines a measure (heart-rate variability,
for example) it does not convert it. Steps are carried by `physical_activity` as
`base_movement_quantity`; there is no separate step-count data type.

## Served schemas without a converter

omh-shim also vendors body schemas that have no `convert()` converter:

- Clinical Open mHealth bodies — `omh:blood-pressure:4.0`,
  `omh:body-temperature:4.0`, `omh:body-weight:3.0`,
  `omh:forced-expiratory-volume-1-second:1.0`, `omh:forced-vital-capacity:1.0`,
  `omh:respiratory-rate:2.0`, `omh:rr-interval:1.0`.
- `ieee:sleep-stage-summary:1.0`, served for downstream consumers that summarize
  sleep stages.
- `omh:physical-activity:1.2`, `omh:sleep-episode:1.1`, `omh:step-count:3.0` and
  `omh:sleep-duration:2.0` — the Open mHealth bodies omh-shim emitted before
  2.0.0 moved them to IEEE. Open mHealth has deprecated all four, so none may be
  a resolution candidate; they stay vendored because they are the evidence the
  successor invariant reads at import, and so consumers can keep validating
  records written under the old ids.

They exist so consumers can **serve and validate** these bodies offline from a
single pinned source:

```python
from omh_shim import known_ids, load_schema

"omh:blood-pressure:4.0" in known_ids()    # True
schema = load_schema("omh:blood-pressure:4.0")  # vendored JSON schema, all $refs resolvable offline
```

These are tracked as `SERVED_NO_CONVERTER` in `tests/test_schema_coverage.py`
(the authoritative list) and refreshed alongside the converter schemas by
`tools/refresh_schemas.py`.
